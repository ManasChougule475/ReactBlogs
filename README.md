# ReactBlogs
Objective is to learn React hooks by building a dynamic blogging app, learn modern functional components and implement app using different hooks like useState() and useReducer() by creating & deleting blogs and more.

##  Description:

In this project, I developed a Blogging App using React and incorporated a range of functionalities. The app allows user to create, display, update, and delete blogs. It leverages various React hooks, including useState(), useEffect(),  useReducer() , useRef() and createRef()  to manage the state and lifecycle of the application effectively.

Key Features:

**1.Create Blog:** Users can create new blog posts by providing a title and content(must). The title fields is designed to automatically receive focus when the app is loaded and re-rendered, making it easy for users to start writing immediately. 

**2.Display Blogs:** The app displays a list of submitted blogs with newly added blog at top fo the list. Added effect to make title of first blog as title of web page. 

**3.Update Blog:** Upon clicking the "Update" button, the content field is focused, enabling users to edit the blog conveniently. User can save and discard his updates.

**4.Delete Blog:** Through a "Delete" button next to each blog entry.

**First all these operations performed in local state then performed using firebase.**
Implemented real time updates functionality using firebase.

Styling: The app has been meticulously styled to enhance the user interface for a visually appealing design.
